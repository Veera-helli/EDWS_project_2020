<h2>Practical</h2>
<p>required installations: </br> Node (with npm) </p>
<p>run with: </br>
  $ npm start</p>
  
<h2>Basic Idea</h2>
<p>A museum/gallery visitor tracker website that is used together with visitor tracker devices. The website is used to initialize, record and archive visitor tracker data.</p>
<p>The course was moved to remote teaching half way through the spring semester which is why we were not able to connect the website with a physical electronic prototype (which had been the goal initially). </p>
